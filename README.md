# World_Weather_Analysis
This project collects and analyzes weather datas from cities worldwide. The purpose is to recommend ideal hotels based on the user's preferences. A Pandas data frame will be created containing 500 random cities weathers in real time. The OpenWeatherMap API will extract the current weather data and the JSON data will be parsed from the API request. The following factors will be included from the JSON: City, country, and date, latitude, longitude,maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Scatter plots and heatmaps will be used comparing the different factors to the different locations in the world. The heat maps will contain pop-up markers that give information about the city.
